<h4>3. Known Issues</h4><para>

<br><br>A lot of VI's require that the instrument be in a certain instrument mode in order to run with no errors. Also, before some measurements can be made, there may be configuration vi's that must be run. 
For example, in order for jitter amplitude measurements to be made, the Enable Jitter Amplitude Measurements VI must be run first.  <br>
<br><br>The command :TDR:RESPonse<N>:TYPE {CSINgle | CDIFf | CCOMmon | UDIFf | UCOMmon} was not implemented. Also, there may be some functionality of the instrument that may not work due to the firmware revision.
 Check documentation or programmer's reference to make sure that your firmware is up to date. Instruments like 86100A and 86100B may also not have all of the functionality of this driver. The testing was done with a 
 86100D so all of these commands will work with an 86100D assuming the firmware is up to date.<br><para></para>
